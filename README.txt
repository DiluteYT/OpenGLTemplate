Thanks for using my OpenGL C++ template! 
I have no experience making tools for Linux or
Mac, so im afraid this is made for Windows without
consideration for other platforms.

Ive automatically linked up GLFW and GLEW to the solution. you can find those in
Dependencies/$(PlatformTarget)

I also have added Main.cpp in src with the contents being the basic window 
building code for glfw and glew.

If you find any bugs or issues, or have any suggestions, please dont hesitate to
contact me.
